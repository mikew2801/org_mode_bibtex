I use Bibtex, and I also use Emacs Org-Mode to write basically everything. I also like to use LaTeX, but many publishers in the humanities require submission of bibliographies in word format.

The following script takes as its input a bibtex file and a CSV file containing a series of styles for given bibliographic systems. It then outputs an ORG-Mode file with some simple formatting. I can then export this from org-mode to libre office, and save it as a word-file. At present I've only inputted the conventions for the MLA styleguide, but it can easily be expanded.
